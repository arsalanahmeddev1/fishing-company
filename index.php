      This story begins long before 1984 with our founder, a <br>
      long haired motocross surfer, <span class="fs-25"> who enjoyed customizing cars, motocross, surfing, building
      </span>
    </h2>
    <p>
      custom surfboards, and other outdoor pursuits. As he grew older, after many broken bones and <br>
      other casualties suffered in the pursuit of fun, he settled into the sport of fishing.

        <p>
          By 1984 he had a family to support, and decided he’d better figure out what he was going to do. Since <br> then, he’s created many successful businesses. And all along the way he’s been a “Fuck You” kind of guy.
        </p>
        <p>
          During his younger years he’d noticed that in the surfing culture people wore unique and somewhat <br> unorthodox clothes, especially t-shirts, so he thought his fishing people needed their own swag, <br> (and we’re not talking Dick’s or Bass Pro Shop). So he started producing hats and shirts for some of <br> his buddies, and it just took off from there. Everywhere he went people said “Where’d you get that?” <br> or “I want that!” He started printing and giving away merch wherever he ventured.

      He’s a can-do guy with a typical type A personality, He’s always been full of innovative ideas and generous to a fault, which led to the inception of Fuck You Fishing. Now he wants to share his merchandise with the rest of the world. Lucky you
