      This story begins long before 1984 with our founder, a 
      long haired motocross surfer, <span class="fs-25"> who enjoyed customizing cars, motocross, surfing, building
      custom surfboards, and other outdoor pursuits. As he grew  older, after many broken bones and
      other casualties suffered in the pursuit of fun, he settled into the sport of fishing.

      By 1984 he had a family to support, and decided he’d better figure out what he was going to do. Since then, he’s created many successful businesses. And all along the way he’s been a “Fuck You” kind of guy.

    <p>
      During his younger years he’d noticed that in the surfing culture people wore unique and somewhat unorthodox clothes, especially t-shirts, so he thought his fishing people needed their own swag, (and we’re not talking Dick’s or Bass Pro Shop). So he started producing hats and shirts for some of his buddies, and it just took off from there. Everywhere he went people said “Where’d you get that?” or “I want that!” He started printing and giving away merch wherever he ventured.

    <p class="mt-20">
      He’s a can-do guy with a typical type A personality, He’s always been full of innovative ideas and generous to a fault, which led to the inception of Fuck You Fishing. Now he wants to share his merchandise with the rest of the world. Lucky you
